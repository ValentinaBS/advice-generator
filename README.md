## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)

### Useful resources

- [The <q> element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q) - This helped me discover an HTML tag I didn't know. I really liked this element, since it allowed me to work with the quotes, without having to add a span element to include the quotation marks.
- [Decorative images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the types of images one can use in a page. It's very important to specify an empty alt attribute to a decorative image.
